## Project Overview

This project implements various data structures and algorithms in Java based on the topics covered in the course. Each implementation is provided in its own Java file with the required functionalities and corresponding tests. The tasks are arranged according to the commit history:

### Commit History

1. **Task 1**: Single Linked List (File: `SingleLinkedList.java`)  
2. **Task 2**: Queue (File: `Queue.java`)  
3. **Task 3**: Stack (File: `Stack.java`)  
4. **Tasks 4 & 5**: Linear Search and Binary Search (File: `Search.java`)  
5. **Tasks 6 & 7**: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort (File: `Sorting.java`)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Single Linked List
- **File:** `SingleLinkedList.java`
- **Description:** Implements a generic singly linked list with support for adding and removing elements from different positions.

### 2. Queue
- **File:** `Queue.java`
- **Description:** Implements a queue using a linked list. Supports enqueue, dequeue, and front operations.

### 3. Stack
- **File:** `Stack.java`
- **Description:** Implements a stack using an array list. Supports push, pop, and peek operations.

### 4. Linear Search and Binary Search
- **File:** `Search.java`
- **Description:** 
  - **Linear Search:** Iteratively searches for an element in an unsorted array.
  - **Binary Search:** Searches for an element in a sorted array using divide and conquer.

### 5. Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort
- **File:** `Sorting.java`
- **Description:** 
  - **Bubble Sort:** Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
  - **Insertion Sort:** Builds the sorted array one element at a time.
